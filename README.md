# Soteria | Vehicle Crash Detection System

The System consists of the following things
#### Arduino UNO - It is a simple microcontroller that can run based on an AC- to - DC adapter, battery or even by connecting it to a laptop.
#### GSM SIM 800l - The module works as a miniature GSM modem, which is integrated into a great number of IoT projects. The module can be used to accomplish almost anything a normal cell phone can; SMS text messages or make or receive phone calls by connecting to the internet through GPRS,TCP/IP.
#### NEO 6MV2 - This works as a GPS module that determines the longitude and latitude anywhere on earth and helps in relaying that info further to output devices.
#### MPU 6050 - This is a 6 axis (Gyro + Accelerometer) that is involved in determining depth of field and can determine the movement intensity of the collision upon occurrence.
#### XAMPP MySQL Database Server
#### Node-Red
